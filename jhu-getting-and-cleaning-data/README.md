# Introduction

This README document explains the solution to the course project for the Getting and
Cleaning Data course.
It includes the steps involved in extracting, merging, and aggregating fields from the
Human Activity Recognition dataset published by researchers at the University of Genova.
The original dataset is available from the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


# Data collection

From the dataset, the raw data files corresponding to the subject IDs, raw sensor
measurements, and labels, are extracted for the training and test datasets.
Descriptive names for the activity labels and sensor measurement features are read from
`activity_labels.txt` and `features_info.txt`, respectively.

For the training and test datasets, the three inputs are merged into two data frames,
which are then concatenated together into a single data frame representing all the
raw and labelled data.


# Feature extraction and aggregation

From this single data frame, a new data frame containing only means and standard
deviations of the sensor measurements (as well as subject IDs and labels) is
generated.
Descriptive label names are then joined to this data frame, and the column names
are normalised for ease of reading.

Finally, the output dataset is generated by taking the mean of each sensor measurement
and label, grouped by activity type and subject.
